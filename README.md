## 🛠 Technologies & Components
- **Arduino UNO R3** (main controller)  
- **Servo Motors (MG995)**  
- **Water Pumps (5V/6V)**  
- **Relay Modules (5V)**  
- **Demultiplexers** (to reduce pin usage)  
- **Voltage Regulators (7805 / 7806)**  
- **Capacitors and Fuses** for system stability  
- **Switching Power Supply (12V)**
